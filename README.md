# Prettify JSON
---
Script gets path to json file and print it in pretty form

## Quickstart

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash
$ python pprint_json.py <path to file>
```

Output:
>```bash
>{
>  "userId": 1,
>  "id": 1,
>  "title": "delectus aut autem",
>  "completed": false
>}
>```


Instead of: 
>`{"userId": 1,"id": 1,"title": "delectus aut autem","completed": false}`

## Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
